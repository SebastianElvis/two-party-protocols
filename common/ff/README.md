## FiniteField

ff or FiniteField is a golang library to do finite field arithmetic or demonstrate it.

## Primer on Finite Fields

* A Finite Field over p is a set of elements from {0...p-1} 
* Fields are closed under all operations
* +,* are modulo p 

## Notes

* Early version (written in an hour)
* All tests are passing
* This library is one many that will constitute a small crypto package I'm working / playing with
